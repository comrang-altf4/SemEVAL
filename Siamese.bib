	abstract = {Recently, deep learning has made remarkable strides in hyperspectral image (HSI) classification, typically necessitating a wealth of training samples. Nevertheless, labeling HSI data requires considerable man-power and material resources which often leads to a scarcity of samples for model training. To overcome this issue, a refined deep contrastive siamese network (DSCN) is proposed for few-shot HSI classification. A lightweight spectral-spatial attention network (LSSAN) is de-signed to enhance the feature extraction capability. DSCN consists of two LSSANs in dual branches. During the training process, sample pairs will be input to different branches, which enhances the separability of the model. Finally, a contrastive loss is introduced, which guides the model to learn meaningful feature representations by comparing the similarities between pairs of positive samples and pairs of negative samples. Meanwhile, an adaptive cross-entropy loss is designed to adaptively adjust the weight ratio of different branches to improve the generalization ability of the model. Experiments based on two commonly used HSI datasets demonstrate the proposal outperforms some state-of-the-art DL-based HSI classification methods facing the challenge of the few-shot scenarios.},
